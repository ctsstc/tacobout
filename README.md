# Tacobout

Find steamy hot tacos near you.

## Let's Tacobout it

TacoBout is the new hotness in food-finding near you. Ever hankering for a few savory tacos after a long day or looking for a quick bite for lunch? TacoBout aggregates all places that sell tacos in your area, with ratings and comments by other taco-lovers so you can let the sour cream rise to the top.

TacoBout is a Rails application developed by TDD, so you will have to have a machine and environment capable of supporting Ruby and gemfile installation.

## Environment

You will need Ruby for this project. You can determine the current project version by looking at the top of the `Gemfile` file.

I would highly reccomend you use a Ruby environment manager like [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install).

## Setup

After you have ruby installed you will also need bundler. You can run the following commands to install the project dependencies.

- `gem install bundler`
- `bundle`

## Running Tests

Simply run `rspec` sit back think about relaxing, then stop, because these are lightning fast tests ‚ö°!

```shell
rspec
```

## Running the Server

```shell
rails s
```

## Rails Console

```shell
rails c
```
